# CuraFrame — Ethical Use

## Purpose

This document defines the **ethical conditions of use** for CuraFrame.

CuraFrame is a scientific reasoning framework. Its value depends on disciplined,
responsible use by humans who understand its limits and accept accountability
for downstream decisions.

Ethical use is not optional.

---

## Human-Centered Responsibility

CuraFrame is designed to **support human judgment**, not replace it.

All interpretation, validation, and application of CuraFrame outputs are the
responsibility of the human user. CuraFrame must be used by individuals with
appropriate scientific training and institutional context.

At no point should CuraFrame be treated as an authority.

---

## Prohibited Uses

CuraFrame **must not** be used to:

- make or recommend clinical decisions
- select or dose treatments for individual patients
- provide medical advice or diagnostics
- operate autonomously in patient-facing systems
- bypass ethical review, regulatory processes, or institutional oversight
- generate or propose actionable therapeutic interventions

Any use resembling the above violates the intent of this framework.

---

## No Harm Principle

CuraFrame adheres to a strict **non-maleficence** principle.

If a use case introduces:
- increased risk to patients
- pressure to accelerate beyond evidence
- obscured uncertainty
- reduced human accountability

then that use is unethical and must be rejected.

Speed and novelty never justify harm.

---

## Transparency and Explainability

Ethical use of CuraFrame requires:

- explicit documentation of assumptions
- visibility into constraints and violations
- traceability of external predictions and data sources
- acknowledgment of uncertainty and indeterminate results

Black-box usage is incompatible with CuraFrame’s purpose.

---

## Population Sensitivity

Population-specific reasoning within CuraFrame exists to **increase safety**,
not to stereotype, exclude, or oversimplify human diversity.

Users must:
- avoid overgeneralization
- treat population modifiers as protective approximations
- recognize individual variability beyond modeled categories

Ethical use requires humility in applying population-level abstractions.

---

## No Weaponization or Coercive Use

CuraFrame must not be used in contexts that:
- coerce medical outcomes
- restrict access to care
- enable surveillance or control of individuals
- support non-consensual experimentation
- prioritize institutional interests over human well-being

Any such application is strictly prohibited.

---

## Research Integrity

CuraFrame is intended to support **honest scientific inquiry**.

Users must not:
- misrepresent CuraFrame outputs as validated results
- obscure limitations in publications or communications
- attribute authority or endorsement to CuraFrame
- use CuraFrame to inflate claims beyond evidence

Ethical research requires restraint in interpretation and communication.

---

## Institutional Oversight

Use of CuraFrame in formal research settings should occur under:
- appropriate institutional review
- ethical approval where applicable
- clear governance and accountability structures

CuraFrame does not substitute for oversight.

---

## Accountability

CuraFrame does not assume liability or responsibility for misuse.

By using CuraFrame, users acknowledge that:
- outputs are hypothetical
- conclusions are provisional
- responsibility remains human
- ethical standards override technical curiosity

---

## Ethical Expansion

Future extensions to CuraFrame must:
- preserve human oversight
- strengthen safety and transparency
- respect existing limitations
- undergo ethical review prior to adoption

Capability growth must not outpace ethical clarity.

---

## Closing Statement

CuraFrame exists to **slow science down where it matters most**.

Ethical use means choosing restraint over ambition, clarity over speed, and
human well-being over technical achievement.

If CuraFrame helps a user decide **not** to proceed, it has been used ethically.
