# CuraFrame — Limitations

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **explicit limitations** of CuraFrame.

These limitations are not temporary gaps or future work items. They are
**intentional boundaries** that protect scientific integrity, ethical use,
and human safety.

CuraFrame is designed to assist reasoning, not to replace judgment.

---

## No Clinical Use

CuraFrame is **not a clinical system**.

It must not be used to:
- diagnose medical conditions
- select treatments for individual patients
- determine drug dosing or administration
- guide real-time clinical decisions
- replace medical professionals

Any use of CuraFrame in proximity to patient care requires independent,
institutional oversight and is outside the scope of this framework.

---

## No Drug Discovery Automation

CuraFrame does **not** perform automated drug discovery.

Specifically, CuraFrame does not:
- generate molecular structures
- design compounds
- propose chemical modifications
- claim convergence toward a viable drug
- optimize therapeutic candidates

All molecular reasoning within CuraFrame is **conceptual and directional**.
Human expertise in medicinal chemistry remains essential.

---

## No Predictive Guarantees

CuraFrame does not guarantee:
- safety
- efficacy
- feasibility
- regulatory acceptability
- translational success

All outputs are **hypothetical**, contingent on assumptions, and subject to
uncertainty. Predictions derived from external computational tools (e.g.,
ADMET models, docking) are treated as *inputs*, not truths.

---

## Limited Biological Resolution

CuraFrame operates at an **abstracted systems level**.

It does not model:
- full biochemical pathways
- genetic variability
- intracellular signaling cascades
- long-term adaptation or resistance
- emergent population-level effects

These limitations are intentional to avoid false precision.

---

## Dependence on Input Quality

CuraFrame’s evaluations are bounded by the quality of:
- assumptions
- constraints
- external predictions
- human interpretation

Incomplete, biased, or incorrect inputs will produce unreliable outputs.
CuraFrame does not infer missing information.

---

## Population Models Are Simplifications

Population stratification in CuraFrame:
- increases conservatism
- narrows allowable ranges
- reflects known vulnerabilities

It does **not**:
- represent individual variability
- replace clinical stratification
- capture intersectional risk fully

Population models should be treated as **protective approximations**, not
clinical descriptors.

---

## No Autonomous Decision-Making

CuraFrame must not be embedded in systems that:
- autonomously select therapeutic actions
- adapt without human oversight
- operate without transparent auditability
- function as black-box decision engines

CuraFrame is designed to keep humans **in the loop**, not remove them.

---

## No Regulatory Substitution

CuraFrame does not:
- replace preclinical studies
- replace toxicology programs
- substitute for regulatory review
- fulfill approval requirements

It is a **pre-regulatory reasoning aid**, not a compliance tool.

---

## Not a General AI System

CuraFrame is not:
- a general-purpose AI
- a generative model
- a learning system that evolves independently

Any AI or statistical tools integrated with CuraFrame are **external** and
subject to the same limitations and scrutiny.

---

## Scope of Responsibility

Responsibility for:
- interpretation
- validation
- downstream application
- ethical deployment

rests entirely with the human user.

By using CuraFrame, users accept that all outputs require independent
verification and professional judgment.

---

## Intentional Incompleteness

CuraFrame is intentionally incomplete.

It prioritizes:
- restraint over coverage
- clarity over complexity
- safety over ambition

Expansion of capabilities must not violate the limitations defined here.

---

## Final Statement

CuraFrame’s limitations are a feature, not a flaw.

They exist to prevent harm, avoid false confidence, and ensure that
scientific reasoning remains accountable to reality.

If CuraFrame helps a user recognize that an idea **should not** be pursued,
it has achieved its purpose.
